# Quick Commands to Test Connectivity of the CloudFormation Template

# 1. Check if S3 access works (should succeed)
aws s3 ls

# 2. Check if S3 access works explicitly via VPC Endpoint (should succeed)
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com

# 3. Test internet access (should fail)
curl -I https://www.google.com

# 4. Check DNS resolution for S3 (should return public IPs, but traffic still routes privately)
nslookup s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com

# 5. Run traceroute to check if traffic is private (should return * * * due to blocked ICMP)
traceroute s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com

# 6. Check active network connections to see if S3 is accessed via private VPC
netstat -anp | grep ':443'

# 7. Upload a test file to S3 (should succeed)
echo "test data" > testfile.txt
aws s3 cp testfile.txt s3://my-unique-bucket-<your-account-number>/

# 8. Verify uploaded file in S3
aws s3 ls s3://my-unique-bucket-<your-account-number>/
